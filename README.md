# Using Include Statements in PICO-8 (Alpha) v0.1.12c

You can find notes in the cartridge and files itself. I attempted to use lua api  
functions to no success, as I expected, but hey, magic is real sometimes.

This should give you an idea of how the cool new include statements work!

Also, when the file is exported to .p8.png, any included files are also flattened  
and saved along with the original p8 file. Pretty awesome!
